Write a shell. The shell should have following features:

* Read commands in a loop and run commands without complete path names

* show prompt with current working directory in the prompt and allow user to change the prompt to a particular string and revert back to CWD prompt

* Handle all possible user input errors

* exit gracefully on typing "exit" or ctrl-D

* allow users to set a variable called PATH which is used for searching the list of executables (just like in the case of 'bash' shell)

* use the keys: up and down array key and run a particular command from history

* include features of input/ouput redirection (>, <), pipes, handling signals (ctrl-c, ctrl-z), fg and bg, etc
